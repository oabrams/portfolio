<h2>Precision Health Capstone Project</h2>
<h4>2019 - 2020</h4>
<p>For my senior capstone project in the School of Information, I was paired with two students in my program and worked directly with our client, U-M Precision Health, to improve the overall usability of their site through competitive analyses, user research, extensive design sessions and usability testing. My team had the opportunity to serve as both UX Researchers and Designers throughout this project. </p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>U-M Precision Health's website has a plethora of information available to its researchers and study participants. However, the site is designed in such a way that key functionalities are hidden beneath layers of navigation. Users are unable to quickly find the resources they need to do their job or stay informed.</p>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a design that differentiates itself from other Precision Health programs and competitors.</li>
  <li>Improve the consistency between pages throughout the website.</li>
  <li>Highlight U-M Precision Health's main functionalities and goals.</li>
</ol>
<!-- <h3>Research Goals</h3>
<p>Through research, we gained a holistic understanding of the usability issues and pain points felt by U-M Precision Health website users. Additionally, we were able to identiy which resources found on the site were most valuable to researchers.</p> -->
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Which aspects of the site do users use most often?</li>
  <li>Which aspects of the site are redundant or unnecessary?</li>
  <li>What are the users' main goals when visiting the site?</li>
  <li>What are the main pain points of the users?</li>
  <li>Who are the main users of the platform?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Research Plan</h3>
<img id="plan" src="images/researchplan.png" alt="plan"/>
<h3>Research Results</h3>
<p>Our team conducted a heuristic evaluation of the site, sent out surveys to Precision Health site users, and monitored card sorting sessions with both users and those unfamiliar with the site. We analyzed results from each research method and gained a better understanding of who the users are, their goals when using the site, and their main pain points. We wrote and categorized UX requirements into <i>must haves, should haves and nice to haves</i> based on client needs and user feedback.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>We began our design process by brainstorming ideas and through paper sketches. We used these sketches to produce low-fidelity, digital wireframes. In this wireframing stage, we concurrently worked on redesigning the site's overall information architecture and simplifying navigation. <br><br> Next, we broke our site into categories by page similarity and designed templates for each category. After presenting our wireframes in class and incorporating client feedback, we designed UI components and generated a style guide that included text styles and colors. Finally, we turned our low-fidelity prototype into the high-fidelity prototype that we tested and validated with users.</p>

<h3>Ideation & Wireframes</h3>
<p>We initially went through all site pages and reorganized the navigation. Based on the new navigation we generated a variety of paper sketches of key screens and design elements. We transitioned our sketches into low-fidelity wireframes beginning with the homepage which served as a guideline for page structure and style for the rest of the site.</p>

<h3>Prototype</h3>
<p>From here, we created the skeleton of a prototype for the entire site by creating an artboard for each site page and linking them together using Figma hotspots. We took advantage of Figmaâ€™s prototyping features by creating a universal navigation component.</p>
<h3>Usability Testing Approach</h3>
<p>We conducted A/B testing within subjects to provide us with concrete evidence as to whether or not our design has solved our project goals. Our A/B testing was conducted in person and compared the currently deployed Precision Health site with our interactive Figma prototype.</p>
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Do new users quickly gain a general understanding of Precision Health's mission and initiatives?</li>
  <li> Using our improved design, can users quickly find important resources that were previously hidden?</li>
  <li>Do users find it easier to navigate through the site using our improved design?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Using the data tracking table below, we noted the number of steps taken, task completion time, and qualitative responses to follow up questions</p>
<img id="uxrequirements" src="images/datatracking.png" alt="data"/>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>In order to analyze our findings, we created multiple side-by-side bar graphs to visually represent the outcomes of the study. For example, as shown below, our participants found resources to gain an understanding of Precision Health an average of <b>62.4 seconds faster</b> using the prototype and in an average of <b>1.6 fewer steps</b>.</p>

<h3>Final Design</h3>
<p>Our final design includes more than 25 different site pages populated with existing content and a number of resuable page templates. We redesigned the homepage, increased design consistency across the board, and made it easier to access important resources. We also updated the overall information architecture to better reflect the needs of all Precision Health's different user groups.<br><br> Below is the redesigned homepage.
