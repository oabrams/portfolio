<h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="holder">

    <div class="aboutmetext">
    <p>My name is Orly Abrams and I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I am currently earning my Masters degree from the University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information with a concentration in UX Design and Human Computer Interaction, and will be graduating in May 2021. I received my BS from the same school in May 2020.  
 </p>
    <br>
<p>In the School of Information, I learned the ins and outs of both the research and design elements of User Experience; as a Masters student I will continue these studies in greater depth. I have conducted competitive analyses and user interviews, and developed personas. I am continuing to explore the benefits of rapid prototyping, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototype design using tools such as Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD. I have already applied my UX and design skills in the real world through my Senior Capstone project and internships.</p>
      <br>

    <p>My studies at the University of Michigan and my internships have taught me to think critically about user needs, how to approach those needs, and ultimately how to develop both creative and realistic solutions that meet the user's goals.</p>
