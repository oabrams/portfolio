<h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="holder">

    <div class="aboutmetext">
    <p>My name is Orly Abrams and I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I am a recent graduate of the School of Information at the University of Michigan. The School of Information is a program that focuses on the intersection of and interaction between technology and people. Within the program, my concentration was User Experience, where I learned to design and develop technology to create more user-friendly products. I had the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of both the research and design elements of User Experience. I learned to conduct competitive analyses and user interviews, and develop personas. Within the design process I explored the benefits of rapid prototyping, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototype design using tools such as Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD. I have had the opportunity to apply my UX and design skills in the real world through my Senior Capstone project and internships. </p>
    <br>

    <p>My studies at the University of Michigan and my internships over the past four years have taught me to think critically about user needs, how to approach those needs, and ultimately how to develop both creative and realistic solutions that suit the user's goals.</p>
